## Objective:

Develop a script or application capable of parsing a provided JSON file, which contains an array of social media creator profiles. This tool should empower a user to sift through creator data efficiently, allowing them to apply filters based on things such as:

- Follower count range (e.g., 1,000 - 10,000 followers)
- Presence of specific keywords or phrases in bio (e.g., "travel", "tech")
- Average video views (e.g., minimum 500 views per video)
- Other ideas you might have!

### Instructions

1. **Setup**: Begin by creating a structure for your project. If you're building a web interface, set up your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. For a command-line tool, decide on the language and libraries you'll use.
2. **Parse JSON**: Load and parse the provided JSON file. Ensure you understand its structure and can access the various pieces of data needed for your filters.
3. **Implement Filters**: Create functions or methods that allow users to filter the creator profiles based on follower count, keyword presence in bio, and average video views. Consider the user experienceâ€”how will they input their criteria? How will you validate this input?
4. **Display Results**: Design a way to present the filtered results to the user. This could be through a dynamically updated webpage, a console log for a command-line tool, or any method that makes the data easily digestible.
5. **Documentation**: Remember to include a README file that guides users on how to set up and use your tool. Explain your design decisions, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.
6. **Bonus Challenge**: Enhance your tool with additional features, such as sorting the results by follower count or engagement rate, or implementing an interactive web interface if you're working on a command-line tool.
